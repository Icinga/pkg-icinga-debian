# ICINGA CONFIG FOR NEB MODULE: FLAPJACK FEEDER
#
# In order to have Icinga run the event broker module, you'll need
# to place a file like this into modules/ by default, and include that
# directory in your icinga.cfg
#
# Note: This is an addon for Icinga 1.x not developed by the Icinga
# team. You can use this sample config for easier integration.


#define module{
#        module_name     flapjackfeeder
#        module_type     neb
#        path            @libdir@/flapjackfeeder.o
#        args            redis_host=localhost,redis_port=6379
