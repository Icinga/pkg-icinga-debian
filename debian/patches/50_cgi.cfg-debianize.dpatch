+# NAGIOS PROCESS CHECK COMMAND
+# This is the full path and filename of the program used to check
+# the status of the Nagios process.  It is used only by the CGIs
+# and is completely optional.  However, if you don't use it, you'll
+# see warning messages in the CGIs about the Nagios process
+# not running and you won't be able to execute any commands from
+# the web interface.  The program should follow the same rules
+# as plugins; the return codes are the same as for the plugins,
+# it should have timeout protection, it should output something
+# to STDIO, etc.
+#
+# Note: The command line for the check_nagios plugin below may
+# have to be tweaked a bit, as different versions of the plugin
+# use different command line arguments/syntaxes.
