Icinga PHP API
==============

This project has been deprecated from usage with Icinga Web, now using
an internal database abstraction layer. Furthermore, development resources
have been changed in order to work on a real core api.

As of Icinga Release 1.6.0 this won't be shipped anymore with the official
release version. Please refer to previous release packages in order to
build/install the Icinga PHP API.

This project will be kept alive as long as there's the need to, but
as of 1.6.0 independant of the official release tree.

If you still wanna maintain this project, or send patches, please refer to
icinga-devel@lists.sourceforge.net or https://dev.icinga.org
